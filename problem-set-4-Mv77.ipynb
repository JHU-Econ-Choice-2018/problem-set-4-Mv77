    "Adopting the belief that the generosity of unemployment benefits increased makes the agents precautionary saving motive lower: he needs to save less as he believes his unemployment market resources are larger. Thus, he dis-saves as he does not need as much precautionary wealth as before. However, after optimism ends he needs to recover with a saving rate that is higher than the original."

    "The Lucas Asset pricing model of the market for trees, tells us that if we assume a CRRA utility function, the equilibrium price of an asset will be $$P_t = \\frac{d_t^\\rho}{\\vartheta},$$ where $d_t$ is the dividend of the asset and $\\vartheta$ is the time preference rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore in absence of other assets, and in a world without uncertainty of dividends, if the dividends per share of the subprime debt halves, their price would become $2^{-\\rho}P_S$ (with logarithmic utility it would halve too) and P_S/D_S would become $$\\frac{2^-\\rho P_S}{2^-1 D_S}=2^{1-\\rho}\\frac{P_S}{D_S}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, if we assume logarithmic utility ($\\rho = 1$), $P_S/D_S$ would stay the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case agents would move their funds to the riskless asset (if there is one) or the _other assets_, but since we assume the subprime market is small, the effect on $P_O$ and $P_O/D_O$ is neglegible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### b) \n",
    "\n",
    "The expected return of an asset is $$E_t[R_{t+1}] = E_t\\left[1+\\frac{\\Delta P_{t+1}}{P_t} + \\frac{d_{t+1}}{P_t}\\right] = E_t\\left[1 + \\frac{d_{t+1}}{P_t}\\right]$$ if we assume there is no predictability in the changes of prices ($E_t[\\Delta P_{t+1}]=0$).\n",

    "\n",
    "An increase in the variance of $d_{t+1,S}$ would increase the covariance term in the right hand side and thus a higher exess return would be demanded from the subprime debt, since we assume the covariance to be positive. As the expected value of dividends remains constant, the only way of also increasing the left hand side and preserving the equation would be a decrease of the share prices $P$. Therefore, the level of $P_S$ lowers and so does $P_S/D_S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This phoenomenon is the model's representation of the intuitive principle that volatility is undesirable and thus, if expected returns are held constant, a more volatile asset will need to have a lower price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, as we assume that the subprime debt market is small relative to the size of the other market, the other market will remain mostly unaffected by this change in the desirability of S. Therefore we would expect $P_O$ and $P_O/D_O$ to remain the same.\n",

    "we would expect the higher $\\rho$ to increase the right hand side for both $S$ and $O$ since both are assumed to have a positive covariance with consumption. As analyzed in b) this would make the prices of both assets decrease as the risky assets become less desirable to the agents and they move resources to the risk-free asset.\n",

    "Therefore we would expect both $P_S$ and $P_O$ to decrease their levels, and as there is no change in their expected dividends, $P_O/D_O$ and $P_S/D_S$ would decrease too.\n"
