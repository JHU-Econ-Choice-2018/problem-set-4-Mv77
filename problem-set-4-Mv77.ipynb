    "The lender is guaranteed to be able to seize payments of up to $N_0$ for the rest of the consumers' life, since if:\n",

    "- The consumer becomes unemployed, his income will forever be $N_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, if the lender is infinitely risk averse and weights the posibility of the agent becoming unemployed as the only and worse case scenario, he will still be willing to lend the consumer any ammount up to $$\\sum_{t=1}^\\infty \\frac{N_0}{R^t}$$ which is the present value of the minimum stream of income he is guaranteed to be able to sieze and begins at $t=1$ because the consumer can only default and be seized in the period after the loan. Notice that\n",

    "An agent that becomes unemployed on period $0$ will behave as a perfect foresight consumer with a permanent income of $N_0$. His human wealth will be $H_0 = N_0 R/r$ and his bank balances will be $B_0 = A_{-1} R$.\n",

    "which, considering that $c_0$ is positive, guarantees a perpetual stream of strictly positive consumption for the unemployed consumer.\n",

    "### iii.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The unemployed consumer behaves as a perfect foresight consumer and therefore, only the present value of his overall wealth matters for determining his consumption path.\n",
